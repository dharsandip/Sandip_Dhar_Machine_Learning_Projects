#Ionosphere Dataset
"""The Ionosphere Dataset requires the prediction of structure in the atmosphere given radar
 returns targeting free electrons in the ionosphere. It is a binary (2-class) classification 
 problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 351 
 observations with 34 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as 
 follows:
17 pairs of radar return data.
